WHY IS LIFE?
</p>
<p align="center">
</font>
<font color=#ff0000>
All life is made up of DARKMATTER. Darkmatter is capture the spirits of the air and bind it into the life. Burning with fire will cleanse the darkmatter and release the airspirit into environment again, leaving only solid blackness. This is why BREATHE, because darkmatter is never cease to want more airspirit for bind into.

Is two kinds of airspirit bind by darkmatter in usually. Together the two airspirit make up <font color=#0000ff>WATERSPIRIT</font> which also need for life yet not bind by darkmatter. Aristotle Greek Element of Earth is darkmatter, of Air is airspirit that can be bound, of Water is airspirit bound by itself.

Is <u>three type</u> airspirit. <b>Greater airspirit and lesser airspirit</b> are both can be bound by darkmatter. If greater and lesser together BURNED WITH FIRE they will bind themself. Also is STRONG AIRSPIRIT that is most common. Strong airspirit is strong enough to CANNOT BE BURNED MUCH WITH FIRE and will stay as <i>unbound airspirit</i>. But if strong airspirit bound by darkmatter will can strip from things <u>very essence of all positivity</u> which is made from lesser airspirit. All three airspirit bind to darkmatter is <b>necessary for all LIFE</b>.

<p align="center">
TOO MUCH GAIN OR LOSE OF POSITIVITY IS BAD FOR LIFE. Positivity is made of <u><i>lesser airspirit</i></u> and SELF-BOUND AIRSPIRIT can gain or lose. Therefore interact with self-bound airspirit can is HARMLESS. Too much positivity can cause <font color=#FF0000>BURN</font> much like burn with fire! Yet lose positivity also is <b>burn</b>. If the darkmatter bound to the strong airspirit will steal positivity, but if bound to lesser and greater it can be give positivity and both too much steal and give are BURN.<br><b><i><font color=#00ff00>Darkmatter bound to airspirit is LIFE.</font><br><font color=#ff0000>Darkmatter bound to airspirit is BURN and death.</font></i></b>
</p>
<p align="center">Darkmatter bound to airspirit is LIFE AND DEATH DUALITY.</p>
<p align="center">Burn comes from MORE AND LESS POSITIVITY and is other DUALITY. Finding <b>sevenfold balance</b> of positivity remains the life.</p>
<p align="center">Darkmatter will become LIGHTCRYSTAL if pure and under stress. The same substance is DARK AND LIGHT DUALITY.</p>
