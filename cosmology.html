<i>(This document details the cosmology of a setting I have been "brainstorming" (by which I mean "overthinking") since early 2017.)</i>

<p>
	The underlying order of the world, and the mechanisms by which magical effects manifest, is best understood in terms of the four types of aether structures: primordia, planes, nodes, and conduits. There are six primordia: the elemental primordia of fire, earth, air, and water, and also the light and dark spatial primordia. While primordia and planes cannot truly be said to have geometrical positions, the easiest way of conceptualizing them is to visualize the primordia as lines whose intersections represent the planes, as shown in Figure 1 below, as each plane is the combination of two primordia.

	Where two elemental primordia come together, an energy plane is formed. These planes cannot be thought of as locations in the traditional sense, but rather immense reserves of magical energies. In contrast, when an elemental primordium intersects a spatial primordium, the result is a spatial plane, which is in effect a three-dimensional space. Each one of the four spatial planes has its own ecosystem and is inhabited by its own races of sapient beings. The four energy planes are Metal (made from Earth and Fire), Lightning (made from Fire and Air), Frost (made from Air and Water), and Wood (made from Water and Earth). The four spatial planes are the Terrestrial (made from Earth and Light), which is characterized by large expanses of land with high populations of sapients; the Celestial (made from Air and Light), characterized by all of its landmass being in the form of lighter-than-air stones and soild clouds; the Infernal (made from Fire and Dark), which is primarily composed of geothermally-active cave systems; and the Abyssal (made from Water and Dark), containing a seemingly bottomless ocean and only very occasionally a cavern containing dry land and inhabited by all manner of gigantic sea creatures. The remaining plane is the Spirit Plane, which is unique among planes as the intersection of two spatial primordia.

	The spirit plane is, quite simply, the location where the soul of every sapient being resides. A soul is an aether node (the third kind of aether structure, but many other types of node exist as well), and it is connected by means of a conduit to the being's body in the corresponding spatial plane. Aether conduits such as this one serve to transport magical energies between nodes. However, neither the soul nor the body of an average person generates magical energies by itself; a person wishing to perform magic must also create a conduit between their soul and some source of power.
</p>

<p>
	The simplest way to obtain this magical power is from an energy nexus: a singular point of limitless magical potential and the only type of node that can exist in an energy plane. Each of the four energy planes contains an energy nexus, and the Psychic Nexus in the Spirit Plane is effectively the same thing. These five energy nexi each offer a variety of magical abilities thematically associated with the plane where they reside; for example, the Plane of Lightning gives control over electricity but also simple illumination abliities and even limited teleportation. A spellcaster who derives their power from one of these five nexi is known as an arcanist. As they repeatedly draw energy over the conduit between their soul and the nexus, the conduit becomes shaped in such a way that certain manifestations of power they have practiced become second nature to them, while other applications are much more difficult to obtain; these manifestations are referred to as a caster's known spells.
</p>

<p>
	In addition to arcanists, there are other types of spellcasters as well. Sometimes, a specific location on a spatial plane, for one reason or another, gains a tiny portion of the power of an elemental primordium other than the one composing the plane. Such an elementally-augmented ather node is known as a locus, and it offers power associated both with its elemental augmentation and with the land where it is located to a spellcaster whose soul is tied to the locus. Such a caster, who draws their powers from a specific location on a spatial plane, is known as a druid. While druids' magic is strong and versatile, it is not always the most reliable, as they can draw less power from their locus as they travel further from it, and can draw even less still if they are on a different plane. Similarly to loci, the Spirit Plane also has powered elementally-augmented nodes: the spirits of elder dragons. As true dragons age and mature, they develop sentience, but their souls are made from the fabric of an elemental primordium. It is possible for an ordinary person (such as a human, merfolk, or sylph) to bind their soul to that of an elder dragon and obtain magical abilities that way. However, this should be done with extreme caution, as elder dragons are cunning and ambitious with little regard for the lives of those they see as lesser; this attitude is prevalent even from when they hatch and only grows more prominent as they gain power, for those who are at all merciful or willing to cooperate with non-dragons on agreeable terms are seen as weak and almost invariably killed by their more malevolent siblings. Nevertheless, some people, known as warlocks, still do seek out the magic of elder dragons out of lust for power or desperation.
</p>

<p>
	The final way for a person to obtain magic is from the void. If the primordia are a grid of lines, the void is the space in between them. By making a connection from their soul whose other endpoint lies beyond all existence, voidmages can derive power from the zero point energy of the cosmos. Void-based spells often require very little actual transferrence of energy; just enough to redirect some other phenomenon <i>into</i> the void. In this way voidmages can counteract the abilities of other casters, using the power of the void to shunt magical energies of a spell being cast out of the plane or to end an ongoing effect. Other applications of void magic include stealth, by making oneself invisible or magically silent, or with enough experience opening up a pocket dimension for a limited time.
</p>

<p>
	While people can gain access to spells by connecting their soul to a self-powered node (nexus, locus, dragon, or void), it is also possible for an inanimate object to have access to a spell in very specific situations. A skilled mage can alter a conduit that is giving them power so that its endpoint is moved from their soul to a physical object they create, thus making a magical artifact. This removes the spell from the artificer's own abilities, though, until they spend the time to reestablish the connection. Artifacts can be created using any of the power sources listed above.
</p>

<p>
	Beyond what has already been stated, there are a few more miscellaneous cases in which nodes and conduits can occur. In some circumstances, two people can create a conduit between their souls. Two people connected in this way can communicate telepathically without limitation, and can allow each other access to their spells.  This is not commonly done, as the process is difficult to reverse and the experience of sharing such a conduit can be highly unpleasant; almost all such connections are between lovers, close friends, immediate family, or otherwise people who already have an intimate relationship. One last type of aether conduit is a planar portal; by various means it is possible to establish two aether nodes that are on different spatial planes and connect them in such a way as to allow travel between them.
