	<h1>Warpage</h1>
	<p class=normal>This is a game that I made when I was in high school. It's kind of like Terraria and Minecraft. I took the source code as it was the last time I had worked on it in high school, fixed any outstanding bugs, and removed incomplete features to make what I am calling the "canonical beta". I may release updated versions here from time to time; I had lots of plans for features that never fully made it into the game.</p>
